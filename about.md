Hi there, my name is Scott. I'm a web developer interested in data science. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve novel problems. I'm enrolled in the Data Science Diploma Program at the University of Calgary, and I previously completed a BSc in Physics at the University of British Columbia. I'm also currently employed at Tiller Digital as a full-stack developer.

I love data-driven projects and I'm always looking to try something new. Get in touch if you want to talk about web development or data science in Calgary.
